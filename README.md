# Turbocharging your Functions development workflow

This repository contains example code for the 2024 Editions.dev workshop on Shopify Functions.

If you are working on the workshop, you can pull from the `workshop-start` branch with the following command.

```
shopify app init --template https://github.com/Shopify/editions-dev-2024-workshop-functions#workshop-start
```

The `main` branch represents the completed workshop, with all bugs fixed in the Functions. You can reference it after, but meanwhile, no cheating!! ðŸ™ˆ
